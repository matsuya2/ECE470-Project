Webot is used as the simulator

## project_update1
- test_controller.py: controller used to make the robot move as seen in the video for this project update

## project_update2
- ball_throw.py: controller used to make the robot move as seen in the video for this project update (shows implementation of inverse kinematics)
- custom_module.py: module created which contains the function necessary for inverse kinematics 

## project_update3
- core.py: contains functions from modern robotics textbook
- custom_module.py: contains a variety of useful functions (ie randomize initial joint angles, etc)
- ball_catcher.py: controller used to move robot arm (will eventually catch the ball)
- camera_stand.py: controller for the camera
